* I tried to stay true to the original design as much as possible.
* I used SVG graphics as a sprite sheet rquested in the css file as a background.

* HTML code is valid and conforms to best practices and standards.
* I tried to use vanilla Javascript instead of jquery to achieve a good and lightweight solution and  avoiding unnecessary dom paints.
