Based on your new requirements update and your feedback. I've updated my app to reflect the better understanding of your requirements and present a closer solution.

I've attached a Demo that contains three different approaches.

<strong> SVG & Some Design Tweeks  </strong> approach I tweaked the design from my prospective. I changed the search button to be in the right side of the input box. I added a delete button indicator to show the user that he can delete this element without hover or touch.

<strong>  Same As Designed </strong> approach I copied the design as it is without any modifications.

<strong>Pure CSS</strong> approach I tried to present the UI using  only CSS without any external iamges or icons.  

You can check the [Demo](http://searq.azurewebsites.net/) here



* This time I tried to stay true to the original design as much as possible.
* I used SVG graphics as a sprite sheet rquested in the css file as a background.
* I used media query  to adjust space and size for smaller screens. 
* css reset is the only external file used.
* HTML code is valid and conforms to best practices and standards.
* I tried to use vanilla Javascript instead of jquery to achieve a good and lightweight solution and  avoiding unnecessary dom paints.
